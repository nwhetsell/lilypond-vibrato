# lilypond-vibrato

This is a LilyPond function for engraving vibrato as a wavy line that [**@Jean-Abou-Samra**](https://github.com/Jean-Abou-Samra) wrote and [shared on the lilypond-user list](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2022-01/msg00205.html) in 2022. Itâ€™s a simplification of (an updated version of) [this function](https://github.com/mwitmer/LyUtil/blob/master/ly/expressive_markings/vibrato.ly) by [**@mwitmer**](https://github.com/mwitmer). [This Gist](https://gist.github.com/grammaton/437fae5990cbabaa2c3c52927969f9c8) is another alternative.
